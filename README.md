## User Experience (UX)<a name="user-experience"></a>
Our primary focus is on creating a seamless, enjoyable user experience. Slidles is designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring that users can navigate and play without any hassle. The vibrant design elements enhance engagement, making the puzzle-solving experience delightful and satisfying.

## Design <a name="design"></a>

### Design Philosophy
Our design philosophy centres on simplicity, vibrancy and user engagement. We believe that a clean aesthetically pleasing design enhances the user's focus on the puzzle itself.

### Design Choices
- **Minimalist Layout**: Ensures the focus remains on the puzzle.
- **Responsive Design**: Provides a seamless experience across all devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Engages users through dynamic feedback.

- **References**
For my sliding puzzle project, I've drawn inspiration from a blend of traditional sliding puzzles and the minimalist elegance of Pantone Colour swatches. The clean lines and abstract forms of Picasso's line drawings contribute to the aesthetic. The puzzle itselp is like a polaroid snapshot, while the engaging interactivity of New York Times games inspire and shape the user experience. This fusion of artistic and functional elements create a uniquely captivating and visually appealing puzzle game.

- ### Colour Scheme
A bright and vibrant colour scheme is used to make the game visually stimulating. Colours are carefully chosen to create a balance between aesthetics and functionality.

- **Colour Palette**

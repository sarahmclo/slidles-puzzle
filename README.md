## Design <a name="design"></a>

### Design Philosophy
Our design philosophy centres on simplicity, vibrancy and user engagement. We believe that a clean aesthetically pleasing design enhances the user's focus on the puzzle itself.

### Design Choices
- **Minimalist Layout**: Ensures the focus remains on the puzzle.
- **Responsive Design**: Provides a seamless experience across all devices.
- **Interactive Elements**: Engages users through dynamic feedback.

- **References**
For my sliding puzzle project, I've drawn inspiration from a blend of traditional sliding puzzles and the minimalist elegance of Pantone Colour swatches. The clean lines and abstract forms of Picasso's line drawings contribute to the aesthetic. The puzzle itself is like a polaroid snapshot, while the engaging interactivity of New York Times games inspire and shape the user experience. This fusion of artistic and functional elements create a uniquely captivating and visually appealing puzzle game.

![ref-pic](docs/references.webp)

- ### Colour Scheme
A bright and vibrant colour scheme is used to make the game visually stimulating. Colours are carefully chosen to create a balance between aesthetics and functionality.

- **Colour Palette**
The colour palette for this site was devised in keeping with the original SLIDLES logo and created in [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/).

<img src="docs/colour-palette.webp" alt="colour palette">

- **Logo**
The Slidles logo is an original creation using Adobe Illustrator and a starting point for the clean appearance of the puzzle and website.

<img src="docs/slidles_logo.webp" alt="logo" width="500">

- ### Typography
Clear, easy-to-read fonts complement the vibrant design without distracting from gameplay.

- **Fonts**
The font Montserrat was carefully chosen and imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
Neue-Helvetica was used in keeping with design inspiration.
Monospace was employed so the timer and moves section were not moving around page whilst incrementing.

<img src="docs/fonts/fonts.webp" alt="fonts">

- ### Imagery
Minimal imagery is used, focusing on the tiles and the puzzle interface to keep the design clean and straightforward.

- **Content Hero Images**
All images were orignially created, optimised and converted to webp with [Convertio](https://convertio.co/).

### Wireframes
Wireframes serve as the blueprint for the website, outlining the layout and functionality of each page. They help us visualise the user experience and iterate on design concepts and scope before implementation.

Wireframes for this site were created by pen and with [Figma](https://figma.com/) and include future feature options to solve new puzzles.

- **Sketch Wireframes**

<img src="docs/wireframes/wireframe-sketch-mobile.webp" width="500">
<img src="docs/wireframes/wireframe-sketch-desktop.webp" width="500">

- **Mobile, Tablet, Desktop Wireframes**
